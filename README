This is a TextMate bundle that can be used to run the commands for managing django in the current project.

This bundle assumes that the root of the Textmate project is the same as the root of the django project.

You can use Cmd-D to run the commands.

Commands:

test - if a file is selected, look for Tests within that file, and run those.  Otherwise, run all tests for the project.
